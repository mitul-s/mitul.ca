Well, it’s been an extremely eventful three months. With intentions of building stability [see [annual review](https://mitul.ca/p/2024)], it turned out to be everything but that. Things are good though, I’m thriving in a different way. I’ve been productive but not in the traditional sense where I’m working on my projects all day. Cliche, but I think it would be better said that I’m working on myself.

One of my primary goals for the year is to document more of my life. It has proved to be a better way to understand myself in a sense of where I’m good, or where I can make improvements, but also having a collection of memories I can reflect on. While spending a month in Argentina, I recorded a daily journal which was a [super rewarding experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J05WVHp5cJw&ab_channel=mitul).

My time in Argentina was more special than many of my other travels. I keep thinking of a word to describe it, and I always land on "complete."

Everything felt right. ¹

I felt like I had everything I wanted, with a strong, fulfilling routine in my days that offered balance and stability. The trip was a reset moment for me.

Before I left for the trip, I let a stream of consciousness flow regarding my goals for the year, and without sounding dramatic, one of them was to expect radical honesty from everyone around me. I think what made Argentina so meaningful is that I actually found it — and in turn, started offering it too ².

I don't expect to be travelling much this year, this is the first time in three years I'm not kicking off a long-term backpacking trip in April. It feels odd, but I remind myself my priorities and goals have changed. I have some trips but they're short or work related.

Here's some highlights over the past few months, and things I continue to keep working towards:

- Consistent with the gym, I hit 16 workouts in March!!
- Fridays at [New Stadium](https://x.com/newsystems_/status/1887512072172241371) are so much fun
- Working on cooking every meal of day
- Spending time with people that value me as much as I them
- Created a small [travel log](https://x.com/typicalmitul/status/1894073979733766157) of my time in Buenos Aires
- Reading for at least ~20 minutes a day
- Vercel had a company wide offsite in Monterrey, where I got to meet all my coworkers
- I [did a podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZFlTNlsLa8e2nYINUG0UF?si=c207029fd02a4087) to support my friend Rudy, I didn't think much about it initially until friends and strangers told me they enjoyed the listen

### Going forward

By default, I’d consider myself a fairly open person, everything I do is shaped by my curiosity of the world. While acknowledging that, I decided to make a change this year and apply the same principles to things I have previously had an aversion to. It’s been teaching me a lot, while sometimes validating for why I was initially averse to certain things.

Relationships have been changing. I've created distance in relationships where I felt I wasn't being offered the same level of transparency. And working on strengthening the relationships that matter to me, whether it's through hosting weekly dinners or simply consistently showing up.

At the moment, I am having trouble finding balance. I try to live my life with a max level of serendipity and spontaneity, but in reality, it's more closer to chaos. I want to slow things down and hopefully the intention of building stability will soon bring that.

Things are still expected to significantly change soon, and hopefully the next update will be around that :)

Anyways, thanks for reading, see you soon.
