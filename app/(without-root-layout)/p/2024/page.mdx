I know I say it all the time, but every year is the best year of my life. I will always do my best to achieve everything I set out to do.

The past few years were dedicated to exploration and understanding—2024 allowed me to reap the rewards of that journey. I can't pinpoint exactly what shifted–maybe it doesn't matter–but for the first time, everything feels right.

I feel in control.

This sense of clarity has reflected positively in all my relationships—with friends, lovers, and family. Building an understanding of what you want and what you will tolerate makes things easier for both you and everyone around you.

## Goals

**Code**

My creative aspirations this year kind of ended up on back burner. While I initially set out to complete six projects; it was deemed difficult as I embraced the opportunity to travel. I managed to bring three & 1/2 projects to life which I'm super proud of.

- [Montreal in Motion](https://typicalmitul.com/montreal-in-motion)
- [Guestbook](https://mitul.ca/visitors)
- A website for a friend and a hackathon project

I had a massive project that's so close to completion but it's been going on for so long, that I just can't get myself back into it. I'll keep trying.

**Photography**

My concert photography declined significantly this year, mainly because I felt burnt out. While it's personally fulfilling, it offers few tangible benefits right now. I shot fewer than 10 shows this year—I haven't kept exact count. I'm at a crossroads: though I'm confident in my skills, I'm unsure how to grow this work into something bigger.

**Friendsgiving**

I love to cook for people, and I'm constantly trying to get better. I hosted a little potluck with a bunch of friends to validate if I truly got it like that. Outcome? I do. It was just super fun to bring different friend groups together for the sake of eating food.

## Learnings

I don't believe people change, including myself. If you keep reinventing yourself, you're likely to seek validation. It's easier, and more rewarding to deeply build an understanding of yourself and accepting the values that drive you. We all have good in ourselves.

## Highlights

#### New Demos 1

The year started off with [New Demos](https://www.newdemos.ca/) 1, where I got the opportunity to present my project [Montreal in Motion](https://typicalmitul.com/montreal-in-motion). This kicked off a domino effect in Toronto that brought 100s of people together for the sake of progress and growth. It also sparked countless new meaningful friendships which shaped my summer back home after my travels.

Shortly after releasing this project, I landed a contract gig that funded my travels.

I'm forever grateful to [internetVin](https://x.com/internetvin) and [Tommy Trinh](https://x.com/tommytrxnh) for what they've done for the city of Toronto.

#### The Last Rodeo: Four months of travel

Travel has been a core part of my life for the past two years and I wanted to do one last, long-lasting backpacking trip, specifically one where I wasn't tied to a job or major responsibilities that affected how I travelled. I don't know if I'll ever do this again, but I'm so glad I did it one last time.

- London
- Turkey (Istanbul, Antalya, Cappadocia)
- Bosnia (Sarjevo, Mostar)
- Crotia (Split, Zagreb)
- Slovenia (Ljubljana)
- Budapest
- Prague
- 6 weeks in Spain (Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante, Malaga, Granada, Madrid, Barcelona again and back to Madrid, Seville, Cadiz, Tarifa)
- Morocco via boat from Spain (Tangier, Chefchaouen, Fes, Casablanca, Essaouira, nine nights in Taghazout)
- Porto, Portugal to end my travels

I could write a million words on this adventure, but that would be cliche. The overall goal was simple, travel until I land a full time job.

#### Vercel

While travelling, I landed a role at Vercel as a Design Engineer. This was a dream company and I'm grateful to be here. It's an absolute honour to be working alongside the people I've always looked up to. Next.js changed my life, and that's probably an understatement.

## 2025

A goal I've been trying to achieve for nearly two years is almost in fruition. That's my main priority for the next little bit.

Every year is quite significantly different from the last, but 2025 is when I introduce stability into my life and I am excited for that.

The air grows denser, and the temperature fluctuates more intensely the deeper one goes into the training area.")
