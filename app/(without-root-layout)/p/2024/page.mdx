# [Annual Review] 2024

![Maximilien Luce Landscape at Saint-Tropez.jpg](https://res.craft.do/user/full/e641214a-6813-30a3-197b-99e0c353494a/doc/da68ab78-5d69-4fd1-8dac-8412ee0c4df5/75c886ab-afcb-4d2d-80b5-bae5e64bdab0 "Saint-Tropez, Maximilien Luce – 1893")

I know I say it all the time, but every year is the best year of my life. I will always do my best to achieve everything I set out to.

The past few years were dedicated to exploration and understanding—2024 allowed me to reap the rewards of that journey. I can't pinpoint exactly what shifted–maybe it doesn't matter–but for the first time, everything feels right.

I feel in control.

This clarity has reflected positively in all my relationships—with friends, love, and family. Building an understanding of what you want and what you will tolerate makes things easier for both you and everyone around you.

## Goals

Comparing my [2024](https://futureland.tv/@mitul/%E2%88%97-2024-%E2%88%97) journal to [2023](https://futureland.tv/@mitul/%E2%9C%A6-2023-%E2%9C%A6), there's nearly no structure lol. This was intentional as I only had two primary goals for the year. For the smaller goals, things didn't go as planned, but I'm okay with that.

### Code

My creative aspirations this year kind of ended up on back burner. While I initially set out to complete six projects; it was proved difficult as I embraced the opportunity to travel. I managed to bring three & 1/2 projects to life which I'm super proud of.

- [Montreal in Motion](https://typicalmitul.com/montreal-in-motion)
- [Guestbook](https://mitul.ca/visitors)
- A website for a friend and a hackathon project

I had a massive project that's close to completion, but it's been ongoing for so long that I just can't get myself back into it. I'll keep trying.

### Photography

My concert photography declined significantly this year, mainly because I felt burnt out. While it's personally fulfilling, it offers few tangible benefits right now. I shot fewer than 10 shows this year—I haven't kept exact count. I'm at a crossroads: though I'm confident in my skills, I'm unsure how to grow this work into something bigger.

### Cooking and relationships

I love cooking for people. I hosted a potluck, partly to see if I could make food people enjoy. More importantly, there was something deeply satisfying about creating a space where different friend groups could come together over a shared meal, each person bringing their own piece of themselves to the table.

## Highlights

### New Demos 1

The year started off with [New Demos](https://www.newdemos.ca/) 1, where I got the opportunity to present my project [Montreal in Motion](https://typicalmitul.com/montreal-in-motion).

ND1 kicked off a domino effect in Toronto that brought 1,000s of people together for the sake of progress and growth. It also sparked countless new meaningful friendships which shaped my summer back home after my travels.

Shortly after releasing this project, I landed a contract gig that funded my travels.

I'm forever grateful to [internetVin](https://x.com/internetvin) and [Tommy Trinh](https://x.com/tommytrxnh) for what they've done for the city of Toronto.

### The Last Rodeo: Four months of travel

Travel has been a core part of my life for the past two years and I wanted to do one last, long backpacking trip, specifically one where I wasn't tied to a job or major responsibilities that affected how I travelled. I don't know if I'll ever do this again, but I'm so glad I did it one last time.

- London
- Turkey (Istanbul, Antalya, Cappadocia, back to Istanbul)
- [Bosnia](https://x.com/typicalmitul/status/1777433751737258475) (Sarjevo, Mostar)
- Crotia (Split, Zagreb)
- Slovenia (Ljubljana, Lake Bled)
- Budapest
- Prague
- 6 weeks in Spain (Barcelona, Valencia, Alicante, Malaga, Granada, Madrid, Barcelona again and back to Madrid, Seville, Cadiz, Tarifa)
- Morocco via boat from Spain (Tangier, Chefchaouen, Fes, Casablanca, Essaouira, nine nights in Taghazout)
- Porto, Portugal to end my travels

I missed out on a lot in Toronto, but it was a trade-off I was willing to make. I knew this trip was something I had to do.

I could write a million words on this adventure, but that would be cliche. The overall goal was simple: travel until I land a full time job.

### Vercel

While travelling, I landed a role at [Vercel](https://x.com/typicalmitul/status/1812914498619253065) as a Design Engineer. This was a dream company and I'm grateful to be here. It's an absolute honour to be working alongside the people I've always looked up to.

Next.js changed my life, and that's probably an understatement.

## 2025

A goal I've been trying to achieve for nearly two years is almost in fruition. That's my main priority for the next little bit.

Every year is quite significantly different from the last, but 2025 is when I introduce stability into my life and I am excited for that.

The air grows denser, and the temperature fluctuates more intensely the deeper one goes into the training area.")
