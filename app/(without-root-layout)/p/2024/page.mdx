_Saint-Tropez, Maximilien Luce â€“ 1893_

I know I say it all the time, but every year is the best year of my life. I will always do my best to achieve all everything I set out to.

The past few years were dedicated to exploration and understanding; 2024 allowed me to reap the rewards of that. I'm not exactly sure what changed, nor does it matter, but for the first time in my life, everything feels right.

I feel in control.

This has reflected positively in all my relationships, whether friends, lovers or family. Building an understanding of what you want and what you will tolerate makes things easier for yourself and everyone around you.

I hold my friends to high standards for a sense of respect. I'm not sure if it's right but I've always had a short tolerance for disrespect. Though I don't believe in

The year started off with New Demos 1, almost a lifetime ago. I presented my project Montreal in Motion, which kicked off a

#### Goals

**Code**

I had a goal to release 6 projects this year but once I started travelling, that went out the window. I finished with three and 1/2 released projects.

- Montreal in Motion
- Guestbook
- A website for a friend and a hackathon project

I had a massive project that's so close to completion but it's been going on for so long, that I just can't get myself back into it. I'm going to keep trying to finish it.

**Photography**

Concert photography kind of took a nosedive this year. I don't exactly have a reason for it other than I felt burnt out. It's extremely rewarding internally, but there's little benefit to it (for now at least). I don't want to count but I don't think I did more than 10 shows this year. I'm at a crossroads in all honesty. I'm confident I'm good at what I do, but I'm not exactly sure how to scale.

## Learnings

I don't believe people change, including myself. If you keep reinventing yourself, you're likely to seek validation. It's easier, and more rewarding to deeply build an understanding of yourself and accepting the values that drive you. We all have good in ourselves.

## Next

A goal I've been trying to achieve for nearly two years is almost in fruition. That's my main priority for the next little bit.

Every year is quite significantly different from the last, but 2025 is when I introduce stability into my life and I am excited for that.

One year inside the chamber equates to just one day in the outside world. The air grows denser, and the temperature fluctuates more intensely the deeper one goes into the training area.
