I started the year in the middle of Buenos Aires watching fireworks with strangers and wondered why everyone was wearing white. I missed my flight home and reconsidered all my life decisions, but thankfully I had friends in the city that I could spend time with.

I was living with the belief I would soon move to New York City once I was home, but little did I know, my drives to Detroit and Buffalo would end with rejections.

I switched to a sublet on King St West and made a point to spend time with my friends while I waited for my visa approval, knowing they soon wouldn’t be a 10 minute walk from me. I spent most of my days at [New Stadium](https://x.com/newsystems_).

By March, my visa was approved and I got ready to move away from home for the first time.

June, I was in New York City. September, I signed a lease.

I’ll be spending my new year in Guatemala and El Salvador, likely hiking, surfing, being on the beach and getting the time away that I sometimes find myself missing. Most often when my travel friends reach out reminding me of our memories together.

I met [Shen](https://shen.land) in person this year and she's a great reminder to be more myself.

I was the first guest on [Rudy’s podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZFlTNlsLa8e2nYINUG0UF?si=73c3fe14627e4450).

I hosted weekly dinners. I made new friends. I lost new friends. I started working from an office again. I flew home to see the Blue Jays win (and my friends and family). The Blue Jays lost.

There’s a certain beauty in knowing I achieved the things I planned for this year. Write more – I mean, here you are. Take photos. Move to New York City. Get my first apartment. Travel less. I think I did it all.

Though there is something disorienting about getting what you wanted. An old friend always used to ask me what’s next.

After years of thinking about it, what’s next is not the point.

I went to Naples and watched them win the championship, my first time in Italy. With a need for stability in my life, I only travelled twice this year. Quite significantly less than the years prior. We’re probably going to pick that back up by a bit.

I said goodbye to my friends. I still can’t believe Daniil cooked for everyone.

Life is a never ending set of side quests. I don’t really like letting the mundane set in.

Focus on building your Dad lore.

There’s a lot this year I did but it primarily revolved around moving to a new city for the first time. I haven’t really figured things out here yet, but I finally feel like I have breathing room to get back to things I’d like to do. The side quests.

I found my first apartment. Though it took awhile, it was nice to jump between Bushwick, Williamsburg and eventually settle into LES.

I hosted a little Friendsgiving party; it wasn’t anything like the one I hosted back home in Toronto but it’s a learning process.

Being in a new city hasn’t been the easiest; I miss the sense of familiarity more than anything. I am happier here, or happier overall. The reality, the texture of moving to a new big city and acknowledging what the changes actually feel like rather than what they’re supposed to feel like is a bit hard, but it’s part of the human experience.

Can I make my life feel like an episode of Friends/Seinfeld/HIMYM? I’d bet so. It just takes time. It already feels like a loop of Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.

I don't know who I am if I am not in a state of discomfort.

It’s more I feel like I’ve reached a position where I’m deeply familiar with the things I do love and enjoy, and have done a great job of instilling them in my life but yet lost touch with them as I played with new, unfamiliar things for the sake of curiosity. That’s probably the best way I can phrase it.


<Figure src="https://inqeleafibjx2dzc.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/main/p2025/Annual%20Review%202025%20Image%20%284%29.jpg" alt="Pokemon Ruby Generation screen with a motivational quote" />

So for the upcoming year, I want to be extremely disciplined. Here’s some examples of what that could include:

Write more. Let’s double or triple the amount of write ups I share publicly.

No more solo travelling. Either a) travel with friends, or b) meet travel friends in their respective countries. Solo travel did wonders for me, it helped me shape who I am. Travelling with friends is hard, there’s different levels of comfort, schedules, risk tolerance and such but the times where it all aligns, makes it all worth it.

Take even more photos but print them. I told my friend the other day, I don’t want to forget what I looked like today. I want to capture myself, my friends and everything in meaningful ways - something more than a 0.5*. So when the time comes and I share my photos (with friends, my kids, my family), there’s a certain level of love thought attached to it.

I got a 3D printer. I want to design something of my own.

I’m going to pick up film photography again. I have been anti-film as every camera I’ve owned has broke, but I’ll remember to be more careful this year.

Never did I enjoy the beach much, but now I seem to be pulled towards it. I think a lot of the influence certain people have on my life, I changed because of them. I want to spend more time in the ocean, more time surfing, maybe learn to swim (better).

Anyways. Everyday is an adventure, and it will continue to be.

If you haven’t noticed I’m bad at telling the “why”, I kind of don’t want to unless someone asks me explicitly. If you think we’d get along, or I can help you, or you can help me. Email me here [mitulxshah@gmail.com](mailto:mitulxshah@gmail.com).

**2026**

Though internalized, a reminder, whatever it takes.
