# Q2/25

I finally moved to New York City. That's the most important part so might as well say it first. It's been everything I expected and nothing I could have prepared for, at the same time.

Everything I wrote about in the [last review](/p/q1-2025); my gym routine, daily cooking and following through with documenting my life essentially disappeared. While acknowledging my time in Toronto was soon coming to an end, I consciously made the decision to let go of structure in service of spending time with my friends and family.

That kind of summarizes the last three months of my life in the best way possible. It all felt right, even with the ups and downs that came with it.

### Highlights

- Hosted weekly dinners for my closest friends
- Daytrip down to Buffalo to get the TN Visa approved
- Trip to London for Figma Config and [Italy](/os/notes/italy) for two weeks (Naples, Palermo, back to Naples, Sorrento, Rome)
- Reunited with so many friends in London. I feel extremely privileged and grateful to have friends in so many places of the world
- Goodbye Party
  - I brought together friends from all parts of my life
  - My friend Daniil cooked for about ~35 people and I'm forever grateful
- All my friends always give me cards / gifts that are so Toronto skyline related which has been cute
- Moved to NYC
  - My first few days were so deeply overwhelming, Toronto is almost, if not, everything I've ever known
  - That feeling eventually faded, if there's anything I know about myself is that I'm capable of adapting quickly
  - I'm loving my time, slowly and intentionally building up a new life
- Vercel Ship

I always thought I missed travelling, but I miss the memories I have of it. The little trip I had to Italy kind of validated that I'm no longer in dire need for it. Maybe I'll change my mind, but for now I'm so glad to be staying still.

### What's next?

- Finding a place to live and neighbourhood in NYC
- Build a foundation, and introduce familiar routine back into my life
- Stay connected to my friends back home
- Let things unfold without forcing it

If you're in NYC, I'd love to hang out sometime. Being new means new friends, new outlets. I'm going to be dedicating more time to photography and video, so I'm keen to meet people who I can learn from, or potentially work with.
