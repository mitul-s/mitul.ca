        I’m still figuring out what my life would look like here, but for now,
        I’m happy to share I’m a curious learner of all things. My passions are

        to build memorable experiences.

        specifically including product roles in banking and operations at Uber.

        In my free time, I’m usually editing or taking photos, binge-watching

        (with hopes to not abandon it), or learning about investment psychology.
