Hi! My name is Mitul 🏄‍♂️ Excuse the mess, I honestly wasn't expecting you. Welcome to the code that controls my evergrowing space on the internet. 

Building out my personal website has brought me a lot of joy over the years, and it's transformed many, many times. I actually try to update it every few weeks. 

If you have any questions, suggestions, think it's the ~~worst~~ best website ever? – feel free to [tweet me](https://twitter.com/typicalmitul) 👋

##### Built with
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
